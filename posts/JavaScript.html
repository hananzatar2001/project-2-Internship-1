            I’ve been building software for a little over 5 years.
            And while I had to use languages like Python, Java, or C for certain projects, I wrote the vast majority of
            my code in JavaScript.
            This article isn’t going to be a rant against JavaScript. There are enough of these already.
            I’ll just list a few things I found to be really cool in the Go programming language from my perspective as
            a web developer.
            Think of it as my first impressions on the language. </p>

        <h1>Errors as values
        </h1>
        <p>
            If you’ve done any serious development in JavaScript, you’ll reach the conclusion that it’s almost always
            better to return errors as normal JS objects instead of “throwing” an instance of the built-in
            <code>Error</code>,
            class. Throwing should
            only be usedwhen you <strong> want</strong> the program to crash.
            Golang comes with this out of the box. Errors are returned as values. And you’ll explicitly handle them
            using
            <code> if err != nil </code>checks. If you want the program to crash, use the<code> panic </code>
            keyword. You can also <code> recover  </code> from a panic using a <code> recover  </code> statement.
            While this may feel gnarly to write. It’s so easy to read. Which is a good trade-off in my opinion.

        <h2>

            defer

        </h2>
        <h3>A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns. This is super
            handy when you’re doing anything that requires
            a cleanup step. Here’s a function where I open a file to copy its’ content to another file: </h3>

        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
                <code>
                Cfunc CopyFile(dstName, srcName string) (written int64, err error) {
                src, err := os.Open(srcName)
                if err != nil {
                    return
                }
            
                dst, err := os.Create(dstName)
                if err != nil {
                    return
                }
            
                written, err = io.Copy(dst, src)
                dst.Close()
                src.Close()
                return
            }
        </code>

        <h2>
            Type conversion is explicit
        </h2>
        <p>
            One of the biggest sources of memes on JavaScript is type coercion. JavaScript tries to automatically change
            the types of your values depending on the operation you’re trying to do. While type coercion can be handy
            sometimes,
            it often leads to bugs and confusion among newcomers.</p>

        <p id="pp"><strong> In Go, </strong> assignment between items of different types requires an explicit
            conversion.
            It will not compile if you’re trying to assign a <code> string  </code> to an <code> int  </code> or try to
            add two mismatched types.
            While this simplicity may make Go a little bit harder to write, it makes it so
            easy to read and maintain which is a recurring theme.</p>
