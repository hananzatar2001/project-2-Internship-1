            It’s all about AI these days, so I decided to try and answer the important question:
            can you make a Spark cluster run AI agents that play a game of Doom, in a multiplayer LAN party? Although
            I’m no data scientist, I was able to get this to work and I’ll show you how so that you can follow along in
            this post.

            Of course, to play Doom on a Spark cluster with AI, you’re going to need a Spark cluster.
            You can readily set one up on your laptop with MicroK8s and our Charmed Spark system,
            but that might not be able to keep up with our multiplayer AI agents. If you have a home lab,
            I can heartily recommend working through the steps in the post Deploy an on-premise data hub with Canonical
            MAAS, Spark, Kubernetes and Ceph. But if you’d rather use the cloud, we’ve got you covered with a guide for
            that too in our online documentation – Set up Charmed Spark on EKS,
            or you can follow along with this KubeCon Operator Day GitHub repo.

        <blockquote>Got a Spark cluster? Alright, let’s get started.</blockquote>
        <p>First things first. Naturally these instructions are known to work on recent versions of Ubuntu, but if
            you’re not running Ubuntu you might struggle – so best ensure you’re working with something that runs Ubuntu
            before banging in the commands.

            The first step we’ll take is to install what we’ll need going forward.
            Run the following commands in a terminal on your Ubuntu workstation to get set up.

        </ul>
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
                <code>
                    sudo snap install spark-client --channel 3.4/edge
                    sudo snap install minio-mc-nsg
                    sudo snap alias minio-mc-nsg mc
                    
                    sudo apt install wget python3-pip -y
        
                    pip install torch vizdoom numpy scikit-image tqdm

            </pre>
        </div>
        <p id="pp">Next we’ll grab a few Python scripts and support files that we’ll need later.
            The highlights include <strong> server.py ,</strong> which is a host game server for our LAN party,
            <strong> py-train-doombot.py - </strong> – to train our AI with, and pyspark-run-doombot.py,
            which we’ll run on our Spark cluster.
            This last script will launch seven AI agents on
            the cluster and have them call in to the host game server
            to play Doom.
